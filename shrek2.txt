Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man!
We've got a big order to fill!

[evil chuckle]

[Gingy] It's alive!

[rattling]

[gasping]

[whinnies] Run, run, run, as fast you can!          

[screaming]

Go, baby, go!

There it is, Mongo!

To the castle!          

[Shrek] No, you great stupid pastry!

Come on!

[all shout]          

[Donkey] Mongo! Down here!

Look at the pony!      

That's right! Follow the pretty pony!

Pretty pony wants to play at the castle!

[Mongo] Pretty pony.

Ladies and gentlemen.

Presenting Princess Fiona

and her new husband, Prince Shrek.

[applause, cheering]

Shrek, what are you doing?     

I'm just playing the part, Fiona.

Is that glitter on your lips?

Mm. Cherry flavored.

Want to taste?        

- Ugh! What is with you?

- But, Muffin Cake...
      

[piano plays]

C Minor, put it in C Minor.

Ladies and gentlemen.

[applause, cheering]

I'd like to dedicate this song to...

Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.

Fiona, my Princess.

Will you honor me with a dance?

Where have all the good men gone
And where are all the gods?

[all chant] Dance!

Where's the streetwise Hercules
To fight the rising odds?

Since when do you dance?

Fiona, my dearest,

if there's one thing I know,

it's that love is full of surprises.       

Late at night I toss and I turn
And I dream of what I need
Hit it!
I need a hero

All right, big fella!
Let's crash this party!

Man the catapults!               

Aim! Fire!

- Brace yourselves!

- Ooh! Purty!             

[groaning]

Not the gumdrop button!

[enraged howling]

Incoming!

Ha-ha! All right!

Somewhere after midnight

In my wildest fantasy
 
Go, Mongo! Go!

Man the cauldrons!

After you, Mongo.

- That's it! Heave-ho!

- Watch out!

Shrek!

More heat, less foam!

Up where the mountains
Meet the heavens above

Out where the lightning
Splits the sea
I could swear there is someone
Somewhere watching me

Heave! Ho!

[Gingy, slow-motion] No...!

[Mongo groans]

[whistles] Come on!

[cheering]

Look out!

- Be good.

- [weeping bitterly]

[sobbing] He needs me!

Let me go!

Donkey!

Puss!

Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!

Today, I repay my debt.

[all] Aww...

[growling] On guard!

He's gotta be strong

And he's gotta be fast

And he's gotta be fresh

From the fight

I need a hero  

Stop!
